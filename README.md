This is how app looks (design is not my cup of tea)

You can select a category and a phtot from that category. After that you will download a better resolution of that photo and, if you want to
install it as your wallpapers or lock screen, you can do it. If not then just press cancel button. Also you can spot that you able to change 
theme of app by switching such option in settings tab avaliable on category screen. If you have no internet connection it'll show an error screen with
"Try again" button on it.

Favorite and loaded images are in the way.
